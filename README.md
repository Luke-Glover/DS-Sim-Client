# DS-Sim Client

This project is a Java implementation of the client side simulator of 
[DS-Sim](https://github.com/distsys-MQ/ds-sim).

### Usage
`java Client [ -v ] [ -d ] [ -c CONFIGURATION_PATH ] [ -ip IP_ADDRESS] [ -port 
PORT_NUMBER] 
[ -a 
ALGORITHM_NAME ]`


`-v` enables a verbose mode, which prints output matching the 
reference 
implementation of DS-Sim client.

`-d` enables debug mode, which enables extra output useful for debugging.

`-a` selects the algorithm used for scheduling. The only valid option is 
`allToLargest`, which is the default.

`-c` passes the configuration path, i.e. the path to the ds-system.xml file 
generated by ds-server. By default, the client looks in the current 
directory. If a configuration is not found, the client will exit.

`-ip` is the IP address of the DS-Sim server. This is usually 127.0.0.1, 
which is the default.

`-port` is the port that DS-Sim server is listening on. The default is `50000`.
